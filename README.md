# Project 2 - Fire-Water-Earth
A simple rock, paper, scissors based mini game.

In this project, I create a rock, paper, scissors mini game.
The goal is to showcase, a simple Javascript algorithm logic and code structure.
Comments are obligatory throughout the code base.

Here are the subgoals set:

- There are two players, the user & the computer,
- The computer choose randomly between fire, water & earth,
- There must be winning conditions based on the move both players chose,
- When one player wins, he scores one point,
- The game must count the rounds played,
- There must be a text input that shows who is winning,
- When either player scores 5 points the game stops & declares the winner,
- The scores, rounds and texts must be updated automatically,
- There must be a way to reset the game.
